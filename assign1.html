                <p>“Distributed” comes from the fact that there isn’t a central entity in charge of the work’s history, so that anyone can sync with any other team member. This helps avoid failure due to a crash of the central versioning server. Open source projects, such as Mozilla Firefox, tend to use this type of versioning.</p>
        </td>
           <td>Centralized VCSs keep the history of changes on a central server from which everyone requests the latest version of the work and pushes the latest changes to. This means that everyone sharing the server also shares everyone’s work. </td>

            <td>
                <p>Centralized VCS allows more access control via folder permissions or by allowing checkout of just the needed sub tree from the repository tree</p>
                <p>Also these systems are more prone to be backed up regularly, allowing for a more reliable environment of work. The quantity of development tools and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) integrating with them is considerable</p>

                <h3>Improvements</h3>
                <p>Distributed VCS, on the other hand, doesn’t allow for partial check out of the repository</p>
                <p>Also, integration with many IDEs and other development tools (like file comparers) are not yet the rule nowadays and, since there are little repository managers with a Graphical User Interface for Distributed VCSs, it can be very hard in the beginning to be efficient and proficient with this type of Distributed VCSs. </p>

                    <p>Also, when someone on the team checks-in buggy code that takes down the project’s application, the whole team’s work is potentially affected since everyone has to have the same codebase.</p>
